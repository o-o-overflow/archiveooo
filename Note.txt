Potential TODO:
   - call delete_stale_files periodically / implement s3 file delete()

   - spawn with random flags if possible
   - recaptcha on flag submit + password reset?

   - golf
   - time the speedrun

   - async delete_vm and enable it for regular users again

   - replay pcaps

   - AMI for faster creation (as in the study)
   - spawn in user-selected region
   - ipv6
